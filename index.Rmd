## About me!

Hi! My name is Nicole Criscuolo. I am a first-year master's student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I was born and raised in New Jersey and have always loved visiting NYC! Some of my hobbies include running, baking, cooking, embroidery, painting, and listening to music. Thanks for visiting!
